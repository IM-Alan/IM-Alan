### **About Me**
Hello! I'm Alan Iñiguez Muñoz, a Computer Engineering student passionate about technology.

### **Favorite Technologies**
I'm fascinated by drones and believe in their versatility to solve problems in various fields such as academia, entertainment, and research.

### **Personal Goals**
My goals are a mystery for now, but that makes the journey even more exciting! I'll explore how to apply what I learn: working in a company, becoming a teacher, or starting a venture? Time will tell.

### **Projects in Development**
Currently, I'm working on a functional animatronic project. My goal is to give it "artificial intelligence" to converse. Though I only have a few 3D-printed parts, intention counts! I'm taking an Arduino course to program the servos and other components for this project.
